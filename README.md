# QuickPlate

Quickplate is an iOS-only application that lets people book a table at a desired restaurant in order to avoid the time waiting when making a phone call and searching for the number. It also allows the customers to order directly from the app to avoid the waiting time for a waiter to come and make the interaction between the restaurant's staff and customers more time efficient. In the end, it helps the restaurant staff to keep track of the active orders and the ones that are ready to be served. They can also cancel the orders and let the waiters know.

The design was made using Figma

The order has 4 different states: 1 - Waiting (In asteptare), 2 - Preparing (In preparare), 3 - Ready (Pregatita), 4 - Served (Servita)

There are 3 types of users: Cook, Waiter, normal user. 
The cook can see the orders that are only in the "Preparing" state.
The waiters can see the orders that are in both "Waiting" and "Ready" states.
In the last screen we can see that the client can see the restaurant's menu and can place orders directly from the app
